These methods enable direct estimation of individual probabilities of disease presence based on all diagnostic information and evaluation of the extent to which a particular diagnostic test has added value in the clinical context (i.e. incremental or added value analysis). This course will briefly introduce this multivariable approach to diagnostic research.",
